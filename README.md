# EdvRegex
Code for analysing the number of EDV principal applicant and their derivates for any year but 
mostly useful for 2018 and 2019 as these year's datas are hard for finding meaningful information
in the site (https://dvcharts.xarthisius.xyz/ceacFY21.html). 
Here, I have filter the total visa issues for Nepalese EDV principal applicant and their family. 
It can be used for anlaysis for any region and any embassy with some modifications. 
So, feel free to use for your analysis if you are edv selectee. 

Step to use this code!!!
1. clone this code
2. Go to https://dvcharts.xarthisius.xyz/ceacFY21.html
3. In that website, select any year for analysis eg. 2018 
4. click on the last .csv file given in that list of .csv files
5. That .csv file opens with whole information of every region namely AF, AS, EU, SA, OC with their edv datas
6. select whole page and copy all of that particular .csv file
7. Run this python file in your terminal #code to run is --> python edvRegex.py
8. It will shows three numerical datas in your terminal i. Total visa ii. Primary Applicant visa  iii. Family visa
9. Also, the whole data will be written in scrap.txt file in the same directory.
